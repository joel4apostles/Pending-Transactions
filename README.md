# Pending-Transactions
EVM compiatble Mempool Pending Transaction

On Ethereum and EVM compitatble protocol, when a transaction is sent, before being added to a block, it resides in Mempool, a mempool or TxPool is a waiting area for the transactions that have not been added to a block and are still unconfirmed. To receive information about this transaction, the Mempool must be queried. When Etherum of any EVM blockchain receives a transaction, the transaction needs to be propagated to a peer node until a miner picks up the transaction and added it to a block, however, before the transaction is added to the next block, the transaction remains in the waiting pool known as mempool, pending transaction or txpool. 


In order to query a Geth node's Mempool, TX-POOL or Transaction Pool: Make a cURL request to the transaction pool/mempool of your node using below cURL request.

$ curl --data '{"method":"txpool_content","id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST ADD_YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_endpoint (HTTPS/WSS)_URL

Replace "ADD_YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_endpoint (HTTPS/WSS)_URL" with with the HTTP provider 

This above line of code will make a cURL JSON-RPC request to your Geth node's transaction pool/mempool by using the `txpool_content` method, which will return the pending transactions and those queued for future execution. The output stream will have two fields: pending and queued.

Querying with Web3.js library to connect and subscribe to pending transactions using web3.js
Letâ€™s examine how to subscribe to pending transactions from the mempool using Web3.js. 

Prerequisites
NodeJS installed on your system.
A text editor
CLI

Step 1.
Install web3.js by executing the following command in your terminal or command line: $ npm install web3

Make sure you have node.js installed and running on our system by checking the version of node installed with this command line: $ node -v
If web3 is installed the installed version will display on your terminal or command line.

Step 2.
Now, let create a text script file and call it index.js, copy this script to your text editor and save

var Web3 = require("web3");
var url = "ADD_YOUR_ETHEREUM_NODE_WSS_URL";

var options = {
  timeout: 30000,
  clientConfig: {
    maxReceivedFrameSize: 100000000,
    maxReceivedMessageSize: 100000000,
  },
  reconnect: {
    auto: true,
    delay: 5000,
    maxAttempts: 15,
    onTimeout: false,
  },
};

var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(url, options));
const subscription = web3.eth.subscribe("pendingTransactions", (err, res) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
});

var init = function () {
  subscription.on("data", (txHash) => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      try {
        let tx = await web3.eth.getTransaction(txHash);
        console.log(tx)
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    });
  });
};

init();


Explanation of the code above:

Line 32-33: Importing the web3 library, and adding HTTPS/WSS)_URL" with with the HTTP provider's wss URL to the variable url.

Line 35-47: Adding a reconnect logic, so that if the connection is dropped for some reason the script will reattempt to establish a connection.

Line 49-52: Instantiating a WebSocketProvider instance, and assigning it to the web3 variable, subscribing to pending transactions. 

Line 54-65: Getting the transaction body by hash, and printing the transactions. 

Step3.
When we run this file with this command on your terminal $ node index.js, it should output a stream of pending transactions currently in the mempool.
